# Big-five-expanding-cards
All right, so in this project, am going to build some expanding cards, basically going to style these panels to have a background image and a heading.I will use flex blocks to align everything and then add a little bit of JavaScript so that when clicked one of these, it changes the class to active and it then expands with the CSFs transition

#Case.

I will be using JavaScript for the event.Listeners will be using CSS transitions to give it the smooth scroll.The heading does not display until the card is fully expanded.

So hopefully you enjoy it.
